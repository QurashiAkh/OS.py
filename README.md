So.. I found this Code in the side-projects folder in my Computer, and guess what? It's my first-ever Python app ever developed!  
I've written inside of it this Piece:  
*"This is the first Project I created in Python, and I'm very Happy with it!"*  

I've fixed some of the Code (with keeping the same Functionality), also removed any misspells and useless code.

The Program itself is just a piece of if-elif statements, but still, it's nice to see my younger self just putting hands on the Keyboard and making something as simple as that.
